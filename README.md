# Real World Data Wrangling â€” IMDb & Netflix Movies ðŸŽ¬

Udacity Data Analyst project. I gathered, assessed, cleaned, and analyzed IMDb and Netflix datasets to explore whether Netflix includes the most popular and top-rated movies from IMDb.

## What I Did
1) Gathered data from two different sources (manual download + Kaggle API).  
2) Assessed data for quality and tidiness issues.  
3) Cleaned, merged, and stored both raw and cleaned datasets.  
4) Analyzed the overlap between IMDbâ€™s top movies and Netflixâ€™s catalog.

## Dataset
- **IMDb Top Rated Movies:** `results_with_crew.csv` (manually downloaded from Kaggle)  
- **Netflix Titles:** `netflix_titles.csv` (programmatically downloaded using Kaggle API)  
- Combined cleaned dataset: `merged_df1_2025-10-04.csv`

## Steps (Very Short)
- Removed missing values in `writers` column.  
- Converted `date_added` in Netflix data to datetime.  
- Split multiple genres into separate rows (`explode`).  
- Separated `duration` column into `duration_value` and `duration_unit`.  
- Merged datasets on cleaned lowercase movie titles (`title_clean`).  
- Saved both raw and cleaned data versions under `date_store/`.

## Results (Quick)
- Only **826 out of 4,883 IMDb top movies** are available on Netflix â€” showing a limited overlap.  
- The **top 3 genres** among top-rated movies on Netflix are:  
  - ðŸŽ­ **Drama** (55%)  
  - ðŸ˜‚ **Comedy** (24.5%)  
  - ðŸ”ª **Crime** (20.5%)
